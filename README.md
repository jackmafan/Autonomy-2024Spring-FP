# Autonomy-2024Spring-FP
Hello everyone! This is Jack from GIEE and Tiana from ESOE. In the final project, we are determined to go beyond theory survey and actually make a movable car. Although we didn't make what we expect at the end, it's still our honor to present the work here. 

##    Environment setting
First clone our project to your PC.
```git clone https://github.com/jackmafan/Autonomy-2024Spring-FP.git```

Then change to the main directory, setting the environment by running the following commands. Make sure you have installed anaconda in advance.
```
conda create --name ItA24_FP python=3.9 -y
conda activate ItA24_FP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation and Demo
In ```eval.py```, we provide 3 functions-testTSR, testLD, evalModel to test our implentation. 

##    Dataset Loading
###    GTSRB
The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a widely used dataset in the field of computer vision and machine learning, specifically for traffic sign recognition tasks. It was introduced as part of a competition at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in 2011 to advance the development and benchmarking of traffic sign recognition algorithms.
